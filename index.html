            <h2>The beggining of the band</h2>
            <p>
                Band members moved to Los Angeles in the 80's. 
                At first, <span class="bolder">Maynard Keenan and Adam Jones</span> met each other through an mutual friend.
                They all worked in different jobs before that.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a while, <span class="bolder">Danny Carey</span> offered to play 
                in the band, because he felt bad that no other drummer would 
                join the band.
            </p>
            <p>
                They're first album, called <span class="bolder">Undertow</span> was marked 
                with heavy metal style, 
                what was going to change forever after through next albums.
